            <h3>It's The Right Thing To Do</h3>
            <p>
              The landmark verdict of 2018 to decriminalize homosexuality is a
              testament to the fact that the new India is open to change. But we
              have a long way to go. Talented young LGBTQ people fear society's
              discrimination and have to hide part of their identity. This
              suffocation subjects them to depression and poor mental health. By
              openly advocating for LGBTQ inclusivity, you will be heralded by
              the community and the allies. In the long run, you will positively
              impact the lives of not just your employees but also the society.
